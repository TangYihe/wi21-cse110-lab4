## Questions
1. The bug is because both num1 and num2 has type string, so the result is concatenating the two strings instead of adding them as number.
2. I fixed it by replacing num1 by parseInt(num1), and replacing num2 by parseInt(num2). Then we would get the numeric sum of two values. Screenshot of fix:
